From the top level folder (urc2018 probably) try running:
$ ./scripts/quick_install.sh

If this doesn't work then try manually going through the instructions below
(and tell me if you figured out what went wrong so this guide/script can be
improved)

Guide for setting up ROS with Gazebo
================================================================================

ROS stands for Robot Operating System and we will be using it for the URC 2018 competition. ROS will be used in place of the framework that we used last year. There is a lot of documentation about ROS online and a lot of libraries that work nicely with it.
Gazebo is a robot simulation software that integrates with ROS. We will attempt to use it to simulate the robot.

We'll use ROS version Kinetic Kane. This is the most recent LTS (long term support) build. It is recommended to use Ubuntu and you should be able to use the same Virtual Machine that was set up last year if you have one. Most of this tutorial was taken from various tutorials on the ROS websites below. If anything goes wrong you should try to refer to them.

This tutorial assumes you have basic knowledge of a linux terminal. At some point I'll write a tutorial for how to use the linux terminal if people want it.

Link for ROS on Ubuntu:

The following will be used to denote things you should type into your terminal. This would mean you would literally type "pwd" into your terminal.
$ pwd

Tell Ubuntu about packages hosted on ROS's website

$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
$ sudo apt-get update

We are installing the full version of ROS. This is 2 gb.

$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
$ apt-cache search ros-kinetic

Initialize some stuff for ROS

$ sudo rosdep init
$ rosdep update

This makes it so some ROS stuff always shows up in your PATH

$ echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

Downloads a tool to install stuff easier onto ROS

$ sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall

ROS should be installed.

================================================================================

Installing gazebo.

it seems like the above instructions installed gazebo. If typing the following fails then notify me.

$ gazebo

This will take a little time on first run while it initializes. This opens up a GUI for gazebo on success. If this works it means gazebo was succesfully installed while installing ROS. This seemed to happen on my system.

This lets ros and gazebo play nice together

$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control
$ roscore & rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo

Gazebo and ROS should now be able to talk to gach other.
