Package Creation
================================================================================

I probably will be doing this for packages on the final robot. This is just some notes I took while following the tutorial. Maybe you will use this if you're experimenting with ROS.

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage

source devel/setup.bash

catkin_make

While in src dir

catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp

. devel/setup.bash

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29

roscd beginner_tutorial
mkdir -p src

Add this to end of cmake

include_directories(include ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp)
target_link_libraries(talker ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(talker beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp)

add_executable(listener src/listener.cpp)
target_link_libraries(listener ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(listener beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp)


devel/.catkin is where catkin will try to build
/home/jwcullen/Documents/urc2018/src;more_dirs:more_dirs2
