ROS basics
================================================================================

This will be fleshed out as I figure more stuff out.


$ roscore
Running this starts the ROS process. This needs to run for other ROS things to work. Currently I just have it running in a separate terminal. At some point I will attempt to get the project to launch this automatically. I do not know how to kill roscore cleanly right now. I am using ctrl-c to kill it right now.

ROS acts as an intermediary beetween various ROS processes. There seems to be two sets of data sources in ROS: (publisher and subscriber) and (service and client). 

A publisher will publish data with a certain "signature" that any subscriber can process in the order it came in. A publisher can have a certain size buffer of how much data to store before old data starts being overwritte.

A service and client both will hang when trying to send or request data until the respective service/client has the data available.
