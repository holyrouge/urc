Running Demo 1
================================================================================

Demo 1 is located in src/beginner/tutorials/src. I created it by following the following tutorials.

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29

Their folder structure will probably get reorgnaized soon.

With roscore running in a separate terminal and while you are at the top level of the directory (ls should diplsy, build, devel, doc, scripts...)

$ source devel/setup.bash
$ catkin_make

In 2 separate terminal windows:
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ rosrun beginner_tutorials listener

AND

$ source devel/setup.bash
$ rosrun beginner_tutorials talker


This means you have at least 3 terminals open right now. One for roscore. One for the talker and one for the listener. Talker should be spamming the console with
[ INFO] [1496168776.752961102]: hello world 3279

Listener with
[ INFO] [1496168776.653306105]: I heard: [hello world 3278]

ctrl-c to kill these.

The source for these are in src/beginner_tutorials/src

I will look into finding a way to launch roscore and these 2 automatically. 

This demonstrates how messages are sent between components which are equivalent to modules from the robot last year.
