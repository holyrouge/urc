Individual nodes are stored in \textquotesingle{}node\+\_\+name/\textquotesingle{} and loaded in \textquotesingle{}main\textquotesingle{} from a J\+S\+ON config file.

To make a new node, create a directory for your node with an {\bfseries init}.py file. In your node, be sure to extend the \textquotesingle{}node\textquotesingle{} class provided here.

\section*{Getting Started}

You will need to have redis-\/server already installed to run any of the code. Remote instances of redis-\/server can probably work as well. To install any dependencies, run {\ttfamily pip install -\/r requirements.\+txt} in the {\ttfamily src} directory.

\section*{Contributing}

Make sure to keep your own node in its own file to keep the repo organized.
